# In this project, we explore a dataset of poisonous and edible mushrooms. The dataset contains three numerical features while the rest of the features (seventeen) are categorical. The purpose of the project is to find a decently working model that predicts whether a mushroom is poisonous or edible. This means that we should use a classifier model for our project. Since the categorical features of our model contain a lot of missing values, we use a tree classifier to predict the missing values and fill them up according to the predictions of the tree classifier. Next we will use one-hot encoding to turn categorical features to numerical values which can be used for training and prediction purposes by our models. The three models we will build are K Nearest Neighbors, Tree Classifier, and Random Forests. The final results show that the best performing model is Tree Classifier and it actually performs best among our models for all the measured metrics.
